🌏 I'm a PhD student at University of Tasmania

🌿 My research interests are land-use change and biodiversity conservation in human modified landscape

🦜 I'm currently working on forest bird conservation in Tasmania, Australia. My project seeks to safeguard bird biodiversity in forestry landscapes by investigating how birds respond to various forestry practices and finding an ideal balance between timber production approaches and conservation goals.
